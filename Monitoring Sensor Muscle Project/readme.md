# 💪 Monitoring Sensor Muscle Project

This project is part of an IoT-based initiative to monitor muscle activity using a muscle sensor (such as MyoWare or EMG sensor) integrated with microcontrollers. The goal is to capture, process, and visualize muscle signal data in real-time for applications such as physical therapy, prosthetics, and activity tracking.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Monitor and record muscle activity using an IoT sensor
- Transmit and visualize real-time data
- Support health-related or motion-detection applications

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- ⚡ **Microcontroller**: Arduino / ESP32
- 📊 **Sensor**: EMG / Muscle Sensor (e.g., MyoWare)
- 💻 **Programming**: Arduino IDE, C/C++, Python
- 🔗 **Communication**: Bluetooth / Wi-Fi (optional)
- 📈 **Data Visualization**: Serial Plotter or Web Dashboard (optional)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The muscle sensor detects electrical activity (EMG signals)
2. The microcontroller reads analog data from the sensor
3. Data is processed and sent to a visualization platform
4. Real-time graphs display muscle activation intensity
